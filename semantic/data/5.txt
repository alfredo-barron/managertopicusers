The central odontogenic fibroma: How difficult can be making a preliminarydiagnosis.
Central odontogenic fibroma (COF) is a rare benign odontogenic tumor derived fromthe dental ectomesenchymal tissues. A 16-year-old Caucasian female patient wasreferred by her dentist for a radiolucent asymptomatic area associated with thecrown of the impacted lower right third molar. A preliminary diagnosis of afollicular cyst was supposed. The lesion was surgically removed under generalanesthesia together with the impacted tooth. The microscopic diagnosis of theexcised tissue revealed an odontogenic fibroma. No clinical or radiographic signsof recurrence were found five years after surgical excision. Despite the various differential diagnoses of homogeneous unilocular and well delimitedradiolucencies of the jaws, enucleation with peripheral curettage, without anyother pre-operative imaging exams or biopsies, can be considered as the treatmentof choice.
