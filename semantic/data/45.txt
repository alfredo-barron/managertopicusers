 Gastroschisis with prenatal gastric perforation and intestinal stenosis is arare and serious anomaly. although there are several case reports, no case seriesexists to suggest the prognosis for these infants.
 In this report a case of gastroschisis with gastricperforation and jejunal stenosis in male newborn is presented with literaturereview. The stomach, small bowel and the part of the colon were herniated throughthe abdominal wall defect. A large perforation site at the anterior wall offundus and a thin fibrous strip that causing stenosis of jejunum was found.
 Gastrorraphy was performed. Stenosis of jejunum was resected and t-tanastomosis was performed, followed by primary fascial closure.
 The prenatal sonographic finding of bowel or gastric perforation are variable. Antenatal bowel dilatation and in particular intraabdominal boweldilatation is prognostically useful for detection of patients with worse outcome.The absence of bowel dilatation cannot fully exclude complex patients. Earlyrestoration of bowel continuity using primary anastomosis and primary abdominalwall closure are not associated with prolonged time for full enteral feeding and length of hospital stay.
 We have presented the first detailed report of surgical interventionand outcomes in case of gastroschisis with prenatal gastric perforation andcongenital jejunal stenosis. Early restoration of bowel continuity using primary anastomosis and primary abdominal wall closure is recommended here. More researchshould be focused to predict complex gastroschisis and to improve prenataldiagnosis and postnatal management, without a significant increase in morbidityand mortality.
