Protection of Nitrate-Reducing Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacteria from UV Radiation byBiogenic Fe(III) Minerals.
Due to the lack of an ozone layer in the Archean, ultraviolet radiation (UVR)reached early Earth's surface almost unattenuated; as a consequence, aterrestrial biosphere in the form of biological soil crusts would have beenhighly susceptible to lethal doses of irradiation. However, a self-producedexternal screen in the form of nanoparticular Fe(III) minerals could haveeffectively protected those early microorganisms. In this study, we use viabilitystudies by quantifying colony-forming units (CFUs), as well as Fe(II) oxidationand nitrate reduction rates, to show that encrustation in biogenic and abiogenic Fe(III) minerals can protect a common soil bacteria such as the nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1 and strain 2AN from harmful UVC radiation. Analysis of DNA damage by quantifying cyclobutanepyrimidine dimers (CPD) confirmed the protecting effect by Fe(III) minerals. Thisstudy suggests that Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms, as would have grown inassociation with mafic and ultramafic soils/outcrops, would have been able toproduce their own UV screen, enabling them to live in terrestrial habitats onearly Earth.
