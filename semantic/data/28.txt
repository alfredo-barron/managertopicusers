 In recent years, in many European countries, morbidity due to acutepancreatitis (AP) has shown a growing tendency. Some studies indicate anincreased risk of contracting AP in the
 The objective of the presented study was evaluation of the clinical courseof AP in patients with diabetes.
 The study covered all patients with the diagnosis of AP, treated insurgical wards. Into the group of diabetic patients were qualified those whoduring medical history taking confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 or type 2diabetes prior to hospitalization due to AP.
 Into the study were enrolled 963 patients hospitalized due to AP. Inthis group there were 87 (9%) patients with diabetes. In patients with diabetes, gallstones were the cause of the disease significantly more often (46% vs. 32%). In the majority of cases, the course of AP was mild; however, in 10.3% ofpatients with diabetes, the course of the disease was moderately severe, and in12.7% - severe AP was observed. No differences were found in mortality due to AP between the groups. Systemic failure was more frequently observed in the group ofpatients with D.T.2. 5.4% and as many as 23.1% with D.T.1. vs. 5.1% of thosewithout diabetes, the differences were statistically insignificant.
 The frequency of occurrence of AP in patients with diabetesincreases with age, and is most often related with gallstones. The clinicalcourse of AP in this group of patients is more often severe, with systemicfailure in patients with type 1 diabetes.
