represents a safe and complete technique to remove benign lesions of the rectumnot treatable by endoscopy and malignant rectal lesions at early stage. It is avalid alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), to conventionaltransanal surgery and to transabdominal resection. In our operating Unit we performed a resection of 8 voluminous adenoma in the rectal ampulla withSILSTM-Port.
 The mean age of the patients was of 51.1 years, the mean BMI was 23.There were not intra or post-operative complications nor conversions toconventional transanal excision or major resective surgery. The postoperativecourse was normal. The average time of hospitalization was 3 days.
 TEVA is easier to perform than TEM and does not require a longtraining and specific and expensive material as the TEM does. TEVA might go toreplace completely TEM.
