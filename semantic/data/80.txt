Martian Superoxide and Peroxide O2 Release (OR) Assay: A New Technology forTerrestrial and Planetary Applications.
This study presents an assay for the detection and quantification of soil metalsuperoxides and peroxides in regolith and soil. The O2 release (OR) assay isbased on the enzymatic conversion of the hydrolysis products of metal oxides toO2 and their quantification by an O2 electrode based on the stoichiometry of the involved reactions. The intermediate product [Formula: see text] from thehydrolysis of metal superoxides is converted by cytochrome c to O2 and bysuperoxide dismutase (SOD) to ½ mol O2 and ½ mol H2O2, which is then converted bycatalase (CAT) to ½ mol O2. The product H2O2 from the hydrolysis of metalperoxides and hydroperoxides is converted to ½ mol O2 by CAT. The assay methodwas validated in a sealed sample chamber by using a liquid-phase Clark-type O2electrode with known concentrations of [Formula: see text] and H2O2, andcommercial metal superoxide and peroxide mixed with Mars analog Mojave andAtacama Desert soils. Carbonates and perchlorates, both present on Mars, do notinterfere with the assay. The assay lower limit of detection, when usingluminescence quenching/optical sensing O2-electrodes, is 1 nmol O2 cm(-3) orbetter. The activity of the assay enzymes SOD and cytochrome c was unaffected up to 6 Gy exposure by γ radiation, while CAT retained 100% and 40% of its activity at 3 and 6 Gy, respectively, which demonstrates the suitability of these enzymes for planetary missions, for example, on Mars or Europa.
