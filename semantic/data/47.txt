As a paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has the ability to edit its P(phosphoprotein) gene to synthesize three kinds of viral protein (P, V and W). Itis technically very difficult to differentiate P, V and W mRNAs, and little wasknown about NDV regulation of RNA-editing frequency. To investigate the rules of NDV RNA editing, the ratio of the P gene-derived transcripts (P, V and W) wasdetermined by sequencing at different time points post-infection. The resultsshowed unstable ratio of V and W mRNA at different time points, and the frequencyof NDV editing was significantly increased at the early period of infection(P
