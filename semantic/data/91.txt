Microparasites of worldwide mullets.
Ovcharenko M(1,)(2).
The present review is focus on parasitic organisms, previously considered asprotozoans. Viral, prokaryotic and fungal parasites caused diseases and disordersof worldwide mullets were also observed. Most of the known viruses associatedwith a high mortality of mullets were detected in Mugil cephalus. Prokaryoticmicroparasites were registered in M. cephalus, Moolgarda cunnesiu, Liza ramadaand Mugil liza. Fungal pathogens were associated with representatives of thegenera Aphanomyces, Achlya, Phialemonium, Ichthyophonus. Ichthyophonus sp. can beconsidered as a potential threat for marine fish aquaculture, especially inculture conditions. A new hyperparasitic microsporidium like organism wasrecorded in myxozoan Myxobolus parvus infecting grey mullet Liza haematocheilusin the Russian coastal zone of the Sea of Japan. The protozoan representatives ofthe phyla Dinoflagellata, Euglenozoa, Ciliophora and Apicomplexa were reviewedand analyzed. The review of myxosporean parasites from grey mullets includes 64species belonging to 13 genera and 9 families infecting 16 fish species
