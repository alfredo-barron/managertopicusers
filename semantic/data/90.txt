Molecular characterization of the first internal transcribed spacer of rDNA ofParabronema skrjabini for the first time in sheep.
Parabronema skrjabini is a spirurid nematode of the family Habronematidae thatlives in the abomasum of ruminants such as sheep and goats. The purpose of thisstudy was to investigate the molecular aspects of Parabronema skrjabini in sheep.The worms were collected from sheep in Sanandaj (west of Iran). The firstinternal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) nucleotide fragments ofParabronema skrjabini were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using twopairs of specific primers (Para-Ir-R and Para-Ir-F). ITS1 homology in thesequence of this study was 69% compared with the sequence data in GenBank. To ourknowledge, this is the first study in the world exploring the genetic diversityof P. skrjabini in sheep based on ITS1.
