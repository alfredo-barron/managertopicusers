 Although pilonidal disease has been a well-known entity for more than acentury, recurrence of pilonidal disease is still not rare. The optimal surgical approach to recurrent disease is under debate. In this study, we aimed toinvestigate the efficacy of "incision and curettage" procedure for recurrentpilonidal disease.
 From May 2009 to May 2013, 42 patients (37 male/5 female)underwent surgical treatment for recurrent pilonidal disease. Incision andcurettage of granulation tissue, hair and debris in the cavity were performed in all cases. Data collection included demographics, visual analogue scale (VAS)score, hospital stay, return to daily activities (lying, sitting down in comfort)and work, and complete wound healing time.
 Mean operating time was 16.6±4.7 (10-24) minutes. Mean pain score was1.4±1.1 (0-5) with VAS. The mean duration of returning to daily activities suchas comfortable lying down, sitting and returning to work were 1.6±0.8 (1-4) days,and 3.3±2.3 (1-15) days, and 10.2±5.4 (5-33) days, respectively. The mean woundhealing time was 19.9±7.8 (7-52) days. During the three-year follow-up period, norecurrence was observed.
 "Incision and curettage" may be performed as first-line treatment forrecurrent cases. It does not require surgical skill and can be easily applied in a short time.
 This simple surgical option, incision curettage provides shorthospital stay and quick return to daily activities, in addition to patientcomfort and satisfaction.
