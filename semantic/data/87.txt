The Alice - "Follow the White Rabbit" - parasites of farm rabbits based oncoproscopy.
The aim of the study, conducted in the years 2011-2013, was to determine thelevel of gastrointestinal parasites infection in New Zealand White rabbits, kept at the Experimental Station of the University of Agriculture in Krakow. The studyshowed rabbits protozoan infection with the genus Eimeria, belonging - based onthe sporulation method - to the following species: E. magna, E. media, E.perforans, E. stiedae and E. irresidua. The highest prevalence of infection, aswell as the intensity of oocysts output (OPG - oocysts per gram of faeces), wasnoted for E. magna and E. media - respectively 31.4 % (19477.3 OPG), and 40.0 %(14256.07 OPG). The infection of rabbits with Eimeria spp. differed significantlybetween years. With regard to oocysts output, the level of infection was stronglyconnected with the age of rabbits, being higher in young animals. However, therange of infection was highest among adults. Among nematodes, Passalurus ambiguuspinworm was regularly found (prevalence reached 21.9%), other species - Trichurisleporis, and Graphidium strigosum were rarely noted. The overall infection withnematodes did not differ between years. Similarly, as in the case of Eimeriaolder individuals were more often infected by nematodes. We observed some trends in parasite oocysts/eggs output; the protozoan oocysts were recorded more oftenin faecal samples collected in the evenings, whereas the nematodes eggs occurred frequently in the mornings. This situation may be related to the phenomenon ofcoprophagy occurring in the mammals of Lagomorpha order. The results of the studyindicate that especially coccidiosis constitute permanently throughout the years an important problem in the rabbitry examined.
