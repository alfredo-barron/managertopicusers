Cadariu F, Enache A, Avram M, Olariu S.

 The colo-cutaneous fistula is an extremely rare post-operative complication of hernias. This type of complication, besides the surgical aspects, raises also a medical-legal problem regarding the production of the fistula and itsconsequences.
 The authors present the clinical case of a 65 years old man, J.N.,from a rural background, who presented himself in the ambulatory with acolo-cutaneous fistula as a complication which debuted a few weeks after asurgical intervention for an irreducible left inguinal hernia. He was submittedto a surgical reintervention with good results.
 The main particularity of the present case is the association of the colo-cutaneous fistula with the presence of the oxyuris helmintiasis in thefistulos secretions.
 Even though it was rather difficult to obtain the patient's consent for the surgical treatment, the intervention had very good results leading to thehealing of the patient.
