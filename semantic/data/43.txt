Acute Alcohol Use and Injury Patterns in Young Adult Prehospital Patients.

The objective was to determine if acute alcohol consumption is associated withdifferences in injury pattern among young adult patients with traumatic injuries presenting to emergency medical services (EMS). A cross-sectional, retrospective review of prehospital patient care reports (PCRs) was conducted evaluatinginjured patients who presented to a collegiate EMS agency from January 1, 2011 toDecember 31, 2012. Included patients were age 18-24 y and sustained an injurywithin the previous 24Â h. PCRs were reviewed independently by two abstractors to determine if the patient was documented to have acutely consumed alcoholproximate to his/her injury. Primary and secondary sites of regional body injury were recorded. Injury severity was recorded using the Revised Trauma Score (RTS).The association between primary injury site and acute alcohol use was assessedusing a chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to control for sexin predicting injury type. Of 440 injured patients, 135 (30.6%) had documentedalcohol use prior to injury. Acute alcohol consumption altered the overallpattern of regional injury (p < 0.001). Alcohol users were more likely to presentwith injury secondary to assault, fall/trip, and unknown mechanism of injury (p <0.001, all comparisons). RTS scores were statistically lower in the alcohol group(p < 0.001), although the clinical significance of this is unclear. Controllingfor sex, acute alcohol consumption predicted increased risk of head/neck injury5.59-fold (p < 0.001). Acute alcohol use in collegiate EMS patients appears toalter injury patterns in young adults and increases risk of head/neck injury. EMSproviders in similar agencies should consider these trends when assessing andtreating injured college-aged patients.
