 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of CT-colonography (CTC) for colorectalnonpolypoid lesions.
 In the period 2010-2011, 51 out of 454 patients undergoingCTC received also optical colonoscopy (OC). Three human readers with high,intermediate and low expertise interpreted the images. Flat lesions were defined as 3 mm or less in height; laterally spreading type (LST) lesions were defined asnonpolypoid lesions with more than 10 mm lateral diameter.
 A total of 75 nonpolypoid colorectal lesions were identified in 21patients: 43 type II-A low-grade adenomas, 2 type II-c Tis adenocarcinomas, 2 LSTTis adenocarcinomas, 24 nonadenomatous (hyperplastic) lesions and 4 LSTinfiltrating tumors (T1N0M0 in 2 cases and T2N0M0 in 2 cases). Per-lesionsensitivity and NPV were 44% and 80.5%, while per-patient sensitivity,specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 80.9%, 93.7%, 89.5%, 88.2%, 88.7%. Thereaders with high and intermediate experience yielded significantly betterdiagnostic performances than reader with low experience (p =0.072 and p=0.030).All the infiltrating carcinomas and 75% of tis carcinomas were detected by allthe readers.
 CTC showed a low per-lesion and an high per-patient diagnosticaccuracy for all nonpolypoid colorectal lesions, but an high ability to detectnonpolypoid colorectal carcinomas. Diagnostic performances are strictly relatedto the reader experience.
