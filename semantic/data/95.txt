Sensory disturbances of buccal and lingual nerve by muscle compression: A casereport and review of the literature.

 Several studies on cadavers dissection have shown that collateralbranches of the trigeminal nerve cross muscle bundles on their way, being apossible etiological factor of some nerve disturbances.
 A 45-year-old man attended to the Temporomandibular Joint andOrofacial Pain Unit of the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology in HospitalOdontològic of Barcelona University, referring tingling in the left hemifacialregión and ipsilateral lingual side for one year, with discomfort when shaving orskin compression.
 Several branches of the trigeminal nerve follow a path through themasticatory muscles, being the lingual nerve and buccal nerve the most involved. The hyperactivity of the muscle bundles that are crossed by nerve structuresgenerates a compression that could explain certain orofacial neuropathies(numbness and / or pain) in which a clear etiologic factor can not be identified.
