Evaluation of selected dietary behaviours of students according to gender andnutritional knowledge.

 Nutrition is a factor influencing physical and mental fitness. Inthis study we examine the lifestyle of university students and its impact onnutritional errors.
 To evaluate the dietary behaviours of students taking into accountgender and nutritional knowledge.
 Using a QEB questionnaire, we were able to evaluate dietarybehaviours and nutritional knowledge of respondents. Our analysis was conductedon data obtained from 456 students.
 We found that nutritional knowledge for women was 34.7% satisfactory and34.7% good. In contrast, nutritional knowledge for men varied, amounting to 40.2%satisfactory and 25.1% good. The number of meals and their regular consumptiondid not depend on gender or the nutritional knowledge of students, however,significant differences were recorded for the types of snacks they eat. A greaternumber of women than men snacked on sweets and biscuits, nuts and seeds, while inthe case of salty snacks an opposite trend was observed. A higher level ofnutritional knowledge correlated with the number of students snacking on fruitand vegetables instead of salty snacks. Moreover, it was observed thathealth-promoting behaviours such as not adding sugar to beverages and not adding salt to dishes were more common with women and individuals with a higher level ofnutritional knowledge.
 Women more frequently snack on sweets, biscuits, nuts and seeds.More men snack on salty snacks, add sugar to beverages and add salt to dishes.Individuals with insufficient nutritional knowledge more frequently snack onsalty snacks rather than fruit. Students with insufficient nutritional knowledge more often commit nutritional errors.
