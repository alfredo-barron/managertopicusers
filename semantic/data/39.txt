 Despite a good percentage of success, mainly related to the ameliorationof patient selection, surgery for slow transit constipation still presentsfailures and late complications, often unpredictable, and sometimes related totechnical variants. The aim of the study is to critically analyze late surgicalcomplications of subtotal colectomy with caeco-rectal anastomosis (SCCRA),examining the peculiar risks of the procedure and possible prevention measures.
 Follow-up data of 43 compliant patients submitted to SCCRA at ourInstitution were reviewed. Patients undergoing further surgery for a complicationclearly related to SCCRA at our centre were included.
 We identified three late surgical complications (7%): a caecaldistension, an ileo-caecal volvulus and an ileal volvulus. all patients weresuccessfully treated. an evident predisposing condition was found only in thefirst case.
 Peculiar long term complications related to the presence of adysfunctional or mobile caecal stump may be prevented by careful patientselection and surgical technique.
