Low seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and chronic chagasiccardiomyopathy in a region with abundance of triatomine vectors in YucatanPeninsula of Mexico.
The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico is endemic with Chagas disease. The main vectorresponsible for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission is Triatoma dimidiata which isabundant in domestic, peridomestic and sylvan cycles. The abundance of vectorsfavours T. cruzi transmission and is a high risk for developing chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC). In the past 10 years, little information was available onparasite seroprevalence and the prevalence of CCC in the Yucatan Peninsula. Inthe present work, we studied two Mayan communities with a high abundance of T.dimidiata and a random serial sample of 233 patients with an alteredelectrocardiogram or cardiac failure admitted to the Regional Hospital. Ahomemade enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescencestandardized techniques were used to detect anti-T. cruzi IgG. In addition, Mayanvolunteers were monitored by electrocardiography. In the Mayan communities, 4.8% (3/63) subjects were positive for T. cruzi antibodies none of them presentedelectrocardiographic alterations, however in seronegative subjects were detected right or left ventricle hypertrophy in 25% (16/63). A remarkable finding was that90% of the Mayan population recognized the vector and 65% of them had experiencedcontact with triatomines bites. At the Regional Hospital 0.42% (1/233) werepositive for T. cruzi antibodies showing compatible diagnosis with CCC; the most frequent pathology in this population was hypertension in 65% (151/233) and theless frequent was dilated myocardiopathy 6% (14/233). In conclusion, theprevalence of T. cruzi infection and CCC can be considered low in Yucatan,Mexico.
