 Hydatid disease is a parasitic disease considered endemic in many parts ofthe world such as South America, Middle East, Africa, Australia and theMediterranean regions. Liver and lung hydatid disease accounts for 90% of allechinococcal cysts. Primary hydatid disease of subcutaneous sites is rare and thesubcutaneous localization of a solitary hydatid cyst accounts for 1.6%. Notenough data exist for this localization, and only many heterogeneous data aredescribed in order to define this rare condition.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: We present the case of a 68-year-old-woman affected by a mass in upper-medial side of her right thigh with a 12-year-growing history.Anamnestic data were accurately collected. Many different radiological andspecific serum tests were performed in order to define the diagnosis. Surgicalapproach was decided in order to excide the mass, and a 6-months follow-up wasperformed.
 Hydatid disease is common in endemic area but uncommonlocalizations, as in subcutaneous tissues, are a rare condition. ScientificCommunity lacks of complete and homogeneous data about the approach to thismanifestation of the disease. Would be useful a complete review of the literaturein order to plan guide-lines for the treatment of uncommon localization.
