 Cystic peritoneal mesothelioma is commonly regarded as a benign neoplasm at its first manifestation. It can only seldom show malignant transformation, andonly after repeated postoperative recurrences.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: We hereby represent a unique case of peritoneal cysticmesothelioma, malignant since its first presentation. We observed a 73 year-oldman presenting with intermittent abdominal pain and periumbilical swelling. Atsurgery, we found an extensive, oval-shaped, multi-lobed cystic formation thatwas surgically removed.
 Histopathology was consistent with a malignant peritoneal cysticmesothelioma. In agreement with oncologists, we decided not to give any furthertherapy because of the few possibilities offered by systemic chemotherapy and thepaucity of published data from the literature. We planned periodical follow-upincluding US scan every six and CTscan every 12 months.
 Several cases of malignant transformation occurring after repeatedrecurrences of peritoneal mesothelioma have been reported. To our knowledge, thisis the first case showing "ab initio" histological features of malignancy,typical of an active, proliferating and infiltrating lesion. In addition,advanced age and male gender of our patient are extremely peculiar
 Our observation suggests the possibility, although very rare, thatperitoneal cystic mesothelioma may present as malignant since its firstmanifestation.
