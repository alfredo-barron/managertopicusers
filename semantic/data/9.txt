Treatment of oral mucositis due to chemotherapy.

 The management of oral mucositis is a challenge, due to its complexbiological nature. Over the last 10 years, different strategies have beendeveloped for the management of oral mucositis caused by chemotherapy in cancerpatients.
 An exhaustive search was made of the PubMed-Medline,Cochrane Library and Scopus databases, crossing the key words "oral mucositis","prevention" and "treatment" with the terms "chemotherapy" and "radiotherapy" by means of the boolean operators "AND" and "NOT". A total of 268 articles wereobtained, of which 96 met the inclusion criteria.
 Several interventions for the prevention of oral mucositis, such as oralhygiene protocols, amifostine, benzidamine, calcium phosphate, cryotherapy andiseganan, among others, were found to yield only limited benefits. Other studies have reported a decrease in the appearance and severity of mucositis with the useof cytoprotectors (sucralfate, oral glutamine, hyaluronic acid), growth factors, topical polyvinylpyrrolidone, and low power laser irradiation.
 Very few interventions of confirmed efficacy are available for themanagement of oral mucositis due to chemotherapy. However, according to thereviewed literature, the use of palifermin, cryotherapy and low power laseroffers benefits, reducing the incidence and severity of oral mucositis - thoughfurther studies are needed to confirm the results obtained.
