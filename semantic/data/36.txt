 Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major problem associated with openabdominal surgery and related to increased morbidity and mortality rates,healthcare costs and also incisional hernia. A negative pressure subcutaneousdrain reduces dead space in subcutaneous tissue by preventing accumulation offluid. The aim of current study was to establish the efficacy of a subcutaneousdrainage system for preventing SSI after open abdominal clean-contaminatedsurgery.
 A total of 62 patients underwent abdominal surgery, betweenNovember 2014 and March 2015, were enrolled. 48 eligible patients, wererandomized into subcutaneous drainage (DG) and no drainage group (NDG).Antibiotic prophylaxis was appiled to each patient. The diagnosis of superficial SSI was made according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) definition.
 The mean age of patients was 48.77 Â± 12.62 years with a male-femaleratio of 21:27. No statistical difference between groups was observed for age,sex, comorbidity, incision type, hemoglobin level, blood loss, hospital stay and operation time (P>0.05). 2 (8.7%) patients in DG and 8 (32%) patients in NDG had incisional SSI but no statistical difference was observed (P>0.05).
 SSI appear to be reduced with subcutaneous suction drains in openabdominal surgery however prospective randomized larger scaled studies should be performed on this topic.
