A fatal complication of an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia:pyo-pneumopericardium due to a gastro-pericardial fistula Case report andliterature review.
Suciu BA.

 The pyo-pneumopericardium is a very rare complication of anincarcerated diaphragmatic hernia. Usually, it depends on the existence of agastropericardial fistula and, in most cases, it is a deadly complication.
 We present the case of a 65 year old man who was admitted to ouremergency service with clinical signs of septic shock. With the help of the CTscan a pyo-pneumopericardium and incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia was diagnosed.He was subjected to emergency surgical intervention with double approach(thoracic and abdominal), discerning during surgery the existence of apericardial abscess due to a gastro-pericardial fistula due to an incarcerateddiaphragmatic hernia. The gastric fundus was resected with abolition of thegastro-pericardial fistula, evacuation of the pericardial abscess, performing thesplenectomy (in order to have a better surgical access) and adequate treatment ofthe diaphragmatic hernia. Despite the medical efforts, the patient died on the10th postoperative day due to septic complications. To our knowledge this is the first case reported in the literature of gastro-pericardial fistula complicatedwith pyo-pneumo-pericardium due to an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia. In such cases we consider that only by performing a double surgical approach (thoracicand abdominal) we can provide a proper resolution of the case, also based on the objective situation found during surgery, where the splenectomy can provide aneasier approach to the diaphragmatic hernia.
