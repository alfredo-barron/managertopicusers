 The extension of iliac-obturator dissection in melanoma patient with metastatic sentinel node of the groin is very debated. More recent studies - inaccord with guidelines for urogenital cancers - suggest the extension to pelviclymph nodes. At present, however, anatomical limits and indications to pelvicdissection are not defined in melanoma patients with metastatic lymph nodes ofgroin.
 A 46-year-old man affected by nodular cutaneous melanoma(Breslow-thickness 10 mm, Clark-level V) on the anterior-medial surface of theright leg underwent sentinel node biopsy of groin. Three macro-metastaticsentinel lymph nodes were removed in right inguinal field and, after 2 weeks, an ipsi-lateral inguinal lymphadenectomy with an extended pelvic dissection wasperformed. During the surgery, we reported the presence of macrometastases alsoin retro/peri caval lymph nodes. As a result of these findings, we decided toperform the super-extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Overall we removed 56 lymphnodes with 9 peri-caval and 2 retro-caval macro metastatic lymph nodes. After aperiod of 49 months, the patients came to our attention with multiple scrotalmetastases. The imagining restaging of the patient was already negative for othermelanoma localizations.
 Currently there are no guidelines about indications and anatomicallimits of iliac-obturator extension in melanoma patients. The extended pelvicdissection is the gold-standard procedure used in urogenital carcinomas. In case of finding of macro-metastases during the surgical procedure, the approach tofollow is even more uncertain. We perform a super-extended pelvic dissection witha good prognosis for the patient.
