Buxtonella spp. like infection in cattle in Sanandaj province, Iran.
Buxtonellosis is a disease caused by the ciliated protozoan Buxtonella sulcata(Jameson, 1926). B. sulcata is a common protozoan of ruminants and may result in subclinical infection or clinical disease including diarrhea. This study examinedthe prevalence of B. sulcata in cattle from Sanadaj province, Iran. Faecalsamples were collected from cattle in the province from May 2013 to June 2014. A total of 217 cattle were selected randomly according to the age, sex, health,management system and season. In total, 99 cattle (45.63%) were found to beinfected with B. sulcata. In adults, prevalence of B. sulcata infection (51.64%) was higher than calves (28.58%) and young cattle (40.55%). The prevalence of B.sulcata infection was also found to be higher in female (47.32%) than male(38.46) cattle. B. sulcata infection was significantly (p<0.05) higher in poorhealth cattle (body condition and weight) (79.54%) than healthy cattle (24.47%). This study demonstrates that cattle are highly susceptible to B. sulcatainfection under a variety of housing and environmental conditions in this region of Iran. The study also demonstrates a significant effect of infection on cattle health.
