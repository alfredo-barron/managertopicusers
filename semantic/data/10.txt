The effect of radiotherapy on survival of dental implants in head and neck cancerpatients.

 To explore the current literature of the survival of dental implants in irradiated head and neck cancer patients considering the role of implantlocation, bone augmentation, dose of radiation and timing of implant placement.
 Pubmed search was conducted to identify articles published between January 2000 and December 2014 and presenting data of dental implant survivalwith radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. Studies on animal subjectsand craniofacial implants were excluded.
 18 articles out of 27 were eligible for inclusion in this systematicreview. 12 out of 18 studies reported favorable outcome of dental implants andradiotherapy with survival rates between 74.4% and 97%. Seven out of ten studies comparing the survival rates according to site of implant placement reported thatimplants were found to osseointegrate with greater success in the irradiatedmandible than irradiated maxilla. 5 studies which compared implant survival inirradiated native bone versus irradiated grafted bone reported that irradiatedgrafted bone showed a significantly reduced dental implant survival rate incomparison to irradiated native bone. 6 out of 18studies in which radiation dosesexceeded 70 Gy reported lower survival rates of dental implants in comparison to the studies in which radiation doses were â‰¤70Gy. Higher survival rates werereported in 2 studies in which implants placement was before radiotherapy incomparison to the remaining 16 studies in which implants placement was afterradiotherapy.
 Dental implants may be affected by radiotherapy especially when theyare placed in maxilla, in grafted bone, or after radiation, however, they remain a functional option for rehabilitation of head and cancer patients. MoreProspective cohort studies and randomized controlled trails are still needed todraw more evidence based conclusions.
