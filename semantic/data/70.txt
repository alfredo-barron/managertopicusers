 The most common disease required emergency surgical operation isacute appendicitis. Appendectomy is the most common surgical procedure in theworld and remains important due to be an efficient treatment method. We aimed to determine seasonal variations of acute appendicitis in our regions and identifythe demographical and regional differences.
 We analyzed retrospectively data of the patients who were admitted tothe Afyon Kocatepe University hospital and Sivrihisar State hospital between 2003and 2012. 839 patients' data were analyzed.
 Mean age of the all patients was 33 Â± 14.7 year. Acute appendicitis was seen more frequent in autumn and spring (P > 0.05). There was no significantdifference between seasons in Afyon Kocatepe university hospital, whileappendicitis was seen more common in autumn than winter in Sivrihisar statehospital (P < 0.05). There was not any relationship with the monthly averagetemperature, humidity, total precipitation amount and frequency of appendicitis(P > 0.05).
 Although appendicitis has a seasonal variation, other environmentalfactors and impact of nutritional habit should not be ignored. Etiology ofappendicitis is still multifactorial. In the future multiparameter nationwidestudies can present country-specific etiology of appendicitis.
