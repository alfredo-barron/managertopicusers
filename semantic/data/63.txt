Improving Planning and Post-Operative Assessment for Total Hip Arthroplasty.
Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) remains the gold standard of treatment for patients who suffer with a variety of hip-related pathological degeneration or trauma.These patients often exhibit significantly less post-operative pain and anincrease in the range of motion of the joint, but there are still relativelycommon instances of debilitating periprosthetic complications that call intoquestion the method for pre-surgical implant choice. Currently, there are twoprincipal options for THA prostheses: cemented or non cemented. Utilizing thecemented procedure ensures a faster acquisition of adequate implant stabilitythan with the non cemented procedure, but can eventually lead to an increasedperiprosthetic fracture risk. Non cemented prosthetic stems are more frequentlyrevised within the first few years following THA due to periprosthetic fracture, but non cemented revision surgeries generally result in fewer complications than those of cemented implants. Surgeons typically rely on experience or simplepatient metrics such as age and sex to prescribe which implant procedure isoptimal, and while this may work for most patients, there is a clear need toanalyze more rigoriously patient conditions that correlate to optimal post-THAoutcomes. The results from the investigation reported herein indicate that anunderstanding of how the percent composition and quality of a patient'squadriceps muscle in both healthy and operated legs may be a better indicator forprosthetic choice. Additionally, these data emphasize that the traditionalmetrics of age and sex inadequately predict changes in quadriceps composition andquality and thereby have comparatively minor utility in determining thepatient-appropriate prosthetic type.
