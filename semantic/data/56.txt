Association between general self-efficacy level and use of dietary supplements inthe group of American football players.

 Increased nutritional demands of athletes should be covered with avariable well-balanced diet, supported by dietary supplements stimulatingsynthesis of energy, development of muscle mass and strength, and improvingphysical capacity.
 The aim of this study was to analyze an association between the level of general self-efficacy and dietary supplement use among Polish athletespracticing American football on a competitive basis.
 The study included the group of 100 athletes (20-30 yearsof age, mean 24.27Â±2.76 years) who practiced American football on a competitivebasis. The popularity of various dietary supplements was determined with anoriginal survey, and the level of general self-efficacy with GeneralSelf-Efficacy Scale (GSES) by Schwarzer et al. Statistical analysis, conductedwith Statistica 10.0 PL software, included intergroup comparisons with theChi-square test.
 Isotonic drinks (74%), vitamin (65%) and mineral supplements (50%) andprotein concentrates (53%) turned out to be the most popular ergogenicsupplements among the American footballers. The group of less popular supplementsincluded caffeine and/or guarana (44%), joint supporting supplements (40%), BCAA amino acids (39%), creatine (36%), carbohydrate concentrates (30%) and omega-3fatty acids (30%). Analysis of a relationship between the popularity of ergogenicsupplements and general self-efficacy showed that the athletes presenting withlower levels of this trait used multivitamin supplements significantly more oftenthan did the persons characterized by lower self-efficacy levels (p<0.05).
 The popularity of some dietary supplements varied depending on thegeneral self-efficacy level of the athletes; the popularity of vitamins wassignificantly higher among the sportsmen who presented with lower levels of this trait.
