The role of serum biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer: Asystematic review.

 Oral cancer is one of the causes of major morbidity and mortalityin the world although incidence varies in the different geographical locationsand races. Advances in molecular biology and cancer research have allowedelucidating serum biomarkers to improve diagnostic methods. The aim of thisarticle systematic review is to highlight the utility and clinical value of serumbiomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer.
 A systematic literature review using PubMed (MEDLINEdatabases) revealed a total of 140 articles related to this topic. Of thosearticles, 29 were included in the final review. We included articles published inEnglish in the last five years, developed in human as cases and controls studies,retrospective or prospective studies and specific studies that analyzed a certainbiomarker in serum.
 All of the studies include in this systematic review found significantdifferences in patients. Of those articles included, 2 used biomarkers todeterminate cancerous phenotype, 11 mentioned their results were associated with worse prognosis and overall survival, 4 correlated biomarker concentration toclinical stages, 4 concluded it could be a helpful in diagnosis and 8 studies didnot find a clear utility of the analysed biomarker. Due to differences in thepresentation of data, meta-analysis was not possible.
 Biomarker use for diagnosis and prognosis is supported by clinicaland scientific evidence is relevant. Nevertheless, after selecting a certainbiomarker, monitoring protocols should be established in oral and maxillofacialsurgeons teams so as we have a correct understanding of biological values.
