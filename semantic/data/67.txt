Although Mesh Plug Repair (MPR) represents an effective method for the treatment of groin hernia, some criticisms still concern adverse effects related to theplug (shrinkage, chronic pain, migration and erosion). Different mesh and plugdevices have been proposed in the past mostly to prevent migration but none ofthese achieved the same popularity as the cone or flower-shaped plug. Authorshereby present a pilot study with a new tridimensional device, denominated NeTPlug and Patch, that avoids any risk of migration. Results after 12 monthsfollow-up have demonstrated low incidence of postoperative and chronic pain, withboth patients and surgeons greatly satisfied. NeT Plug and Patch has proven toachieve a simple and effective repair for primary inguinal hernias.
