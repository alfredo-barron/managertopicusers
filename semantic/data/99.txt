Effectiveness of dentist's intervention in smoking cessation: A review.

 Smoking is one of the main public health problems in developedcountries. Despite extensive evidence on the effects of smoking on both oral and general health, the rate of smoking cessation is not promising.
 To review the evidence on knowledge and programs forsmoking cessation developed by dentists, a literature review was carried out onprograms for smoking cessation from the dentist's perspective, as well as areview of behavioral guidelines that have been recently proposed for theseinterventions. We used the keywords "Tobacco", "Smoking Prevention", "PublicHealth" AND "Dentistry", to identify controlled studies, systematic reviews andmeta-analyses published between 1999 and 2014, in Google Scholar, SCOPUS andPubMed.
 Out of 177 studies found, 35 were considered, and these were dividedinto 2 groups of 20 and 15 articles respectively, according to type of study and inclusion criteria.
 There is considerable scientific evidence describing the programsfor smoking cessation used in dentistry, which support their effectiveness.Overall, these are brief behavioral interventions complemented by pharmacologicaltreatment, with the participation of the entire dental team.
