Clinical evaluation of neodymium-iron-boron (Ne2Fe14B) rare earth magnets in the treatment of mid line diastemas.

 To evaluate the closure of midline diastema using theNeodymium-Iron-Boron magnets and to compare the treatment duration of midlinediastemas with the use of magnets compared to regular orthodontic treatment.
 Thirty patients with age group 12 to 30 years with themidline diastema ranging from 0.5 to 3mm were selected. These patients weredivided into two groups. Diastema closure in one group was accomplished byconventional method, in other group was done with Ne2Fe14B magnets. These magnetswere fitted to the labial surfaces of the maxillary central incisors such a waythat the opposite poles of the magnets face each other. At each appointment,study models and radiographs were taken for study subjects and the midlinediastema was measured using digital vernier calipers on the study modelsobtained. Descriptive statistics carried out using Paired t-test.
 Subjects treated with Ne2Fe14B magnets showed a significant differencecompared to fixed orthodontic appliance subjects with respect to time of closure,rate of space closure and incisal inclination. Significant difference between 2groups with reduction of 64.6 days in time to diastema closure in subjectstreated with Ne2Fe14B magnets (P<0.05).
 Ne2Fe14B magnets more efficient in complete closure of mid linediastema in less duration of time.
