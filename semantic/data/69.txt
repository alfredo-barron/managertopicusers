 Thyroidectomy is the most frequently performed endocrine surgery, andin recent years, the surgical instruments and techniques used in this surgeryhave greatly evolved. New devices are created to facilitate dissection,haemostasis increasing the intraoperative cost.
MATERIAL AND  We prospectively examined patients undergoing to traditionalthyroidectomy using reusable vs disposable devices (BiClamp 150, ERBE ® - group Avs. Harmonic Focus, ETHICON® - group B). The patients were treated for benign andmalignant diseases from two experienced surgeons. The two groups were separatedbased on age, sex, skin-to-skin operative time, the number of parathyroid glands identified by the surgeon during the operation, preand post-operative serumcalcium levels evaluated with PTH until 24 hours after surgery, the mean hospitalstay, the evaluation of the content of the drainages at 6 hours and 24 hours, andthe thyroid gland volume calculated via ultrasound preoperatively. The patientswere asked to complete a form at 24 hours post-op to self-evaluate dysphagia toliquids and pain on a scale from 0 to 10.
 The patients analysed were 80 pts. Analysis of the data showed nosignificant differences between the groups with respect to age, (p = 0:48), orgender, 9 males and 31 females in group A and 8 males and 32 females in groupB.The thyroid volume (in ml), calculated on the basis of preoperativeultrasonography, was 43.89 ± 37.10 in group A vs. 54.54 ± 51.92 in group B (p =0.35). The skin-to-skin operative time was equal to 50.16 ± 10.43 min.vs. 52.39 ±11:54 min.(p = 0.36) in groups A and B, respectively. No statisticallysignificant differences in pre e postoperative calcium levels. The amount ofdrainage at 6 hours after surgery was 16.63 ± 15.24ml. in group A and 23.72 ±21.93ml. in group B (p = 0.07). At 24 hours after surgery, the amount was 57.84 ±32.56ml. in group A and 66.79 ± 39.94ml. in group B (p = 0.28). For group A andgroup B, we analysed dysphagia for liquids on a scale from 0 to 10 (4.5 ± 2.35vs. 4.18 ± 2.4, p = 0.48, respectively), alterations in patients' tone of voice(1.97 ± 2.51 vs. 1.43 ± 0:48, p = 0.29, respectively), and postoperative pain at 24 hours after surgery (2.76 ± 1.99 vs. 2.68 ± 2.12, p = 0.87, respectively). Theaverage cost for group A was equal to € 25 × 40 = 1000 vs. € 450 × 40 = 18000 forGroup B. The hospital stay in days was equal to 1.70 ± 0.46 (Group A) vs. 1.66 ± 0.53 (Group B) (p = 0.69).
 One limitation of the current study is its small sample size. Bothdevices are effective and safe for total thyroidectomy because they have similar effects on the operative time, postoperative bleeding and patient outcomes inendocrine experienced surgical team. On the other hand, in a time of the spendingreview and the standardisation of surgical techniques to ensure the highestquality of services offered, the BiClamp is a viable alternative tool with a highsecurity standard and low cost that offers significant savings to the health caresystem.
