 Mortality in splenic injuries can create medico-legal problems. Though many studies exist regarding splenic injuries, there are not a sufficient numberinvestigating the factors in splenic injuries influencing mortality. In thisstudy, we aimed to investigate the factors affecting mortality in splenicinjuries.
 All 237 patients with splenic injury between 2005 to 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups,survivors and non-survivors. Age, gender, mechanism of injury, grade of splenicinjury, pulse, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin levels,number of transfusions, surgical procedure, ISS, RTS and hospitalization periodwere recorded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to comparesurvivors and non-survivors.
 The average age of the patients was 32 and most (82.7%) were male.Mortality was observed in 18 patients (7.6%). Mortality was found significantlylower in patients who had isolated splenic injury (p=0.048). In univariateanalyses, decreased RTS (p<0.001), increased number of blood transfusion(p<0.001), decreased hemoglobin level (p=0, 025) and increased ISS (p<0.001) werefound significant in non-survivors. In multivariate analysis; number oftransfusions, ISS and RTS were found as independent risk factors for mortality.
 We found high number of transfusions, high ISS and low RTS asindependent risk factors for mortality in patients with splenic injury.
