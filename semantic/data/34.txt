 This paper aims to compare EVLA to traditional surgery, by evaluating theincidence of recurrences.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: We performed a meta-analysis to challenge both surgical andLASER treatment, using, as clinical outcome, the presence or the absence ofreflux. A systematic review of literature about the treatment of varicose veinswas performed, searching in the following databases: PUBMED-MEDLINE, CochraneLibrary. Search terms considered were: stripping, HL/S, surgery, LASER, EVL*,varicose vein, GSV, saphenous vein. Only RCTs based at least on sixmonthsfollow-up were considered eligible in the study. Methodological quality of theincluded studies was evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration Bias Risk Assessment Tool. Effects of the dichotomous variables taken in consideration were evaluated using pooled risk-ratios with 95% C.I. Articles were evaluated initially fromabstracts; eligible papers were fulltext examined.
 We have considered 2 groups, A and B. A Group: 756 legs treated withconventional surgical procedure; B Group: 755 legs treated with EVLA technique. AGroup showed 175 post-procedure recurrences, while B showed 97 recurrences. Theaverage O.R. was 1.72; minimum O.R. was of .497 while the maximum was of 8.064.
 The obtained OR average value is 1.72 with a 95% C.I. of 0.94-3.12,which includes the value 1, contrary to the criteria for rejection of the nullhypothesis. For this reason there is not a statistically significant differencebetween the results obtained by the two techniques.
 The endovascular laser ablation (EVLA) does not prove to be superiorin terms of recurrence, to the surgical technique. However, it remains a viabletreatment option in patients with impaired great saphenous vein, reducingpostoperative pain and hospital stay.
