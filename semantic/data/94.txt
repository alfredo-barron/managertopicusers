Kissing molars extraction: Case series and review of the literature.
Kissing molars are a very rare form of inclusion defined as molars included inthe same quadrant, with occlusal surfaces contacting each other within a singledental follicle. We present four cases of this pathology: a 35 year-old male,referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Hospital Virgen del Rocio in Seville, and three females of 24, 26, and 31 years, all of which hadkissing molars that were treated by tooth extraction. We have found only 10 casespublished in the medical literature in which this type of inclusion is brieflydescribed, none of which elaborate on the surgical technique employed. In thesecases, the indication for surgery is established when there is a history ofrecurring infections or cystic lesions associated with dental inclusions. Theextraction of kissing molars requires an exhaustive comprehension of the anatomy of the region involved, sufficiently developed surgical abilities, and anextensive planning process.
