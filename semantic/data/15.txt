Effectiveness of intra-alveolar chlorhexidine gel in reducing dry socketfollowing surgical extraction of lower third molars. A pilot study.

 Dry socket is one of the most studied complications in dentistry and several studies have sought an effective and safe method for its prevention andtreatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness ofintra-alveolar gel chlorhexidine in preventing dry socket after the surgicalremoval of third molars.
 The sample involved the treatment of 40 patients whorequired extraction of third molars impacted, which were randomly assigned toresearch groups: experimental group (chlorhexidine gel 0.12%) and control group(placebo gel). Performed the extraction was administered 1 mL of chlorhexidinegel or 1 mL of placebo gel within the socket. The removal of suture was on thefifth postoperative day in which the presence or absence of dry socket wasevaluated.
 No relationship between the appearance of dry socket after applicationof chlorhexidine gel or placebo gel (X2 test, p = 0.311) was found. However,significant differences (U Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.036) in the pain presented onthe fifth postoperative day were evident (VAS).
 The administration of intra-alveolar chlorhexidine gel 0.12% couldgenerate a better response to postoperative pain after the removal of thirdmolars.
