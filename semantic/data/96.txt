An analysis in vivo of intracanal bacterial load before and afterchemo-mechanical preparation: A comparative analysis of two irrigants and twoactivation techniques.

 The goals of this randomized double-blind trial were to assess theantimicrobial activity in vivo of Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) vs. chlorhexidinegluconate (CHX) used in combination either with EndoActivator® or IRRI S® filesin patients with apical periodontitis.
 No significant differences were observed between NaOCl and CHX in thereduction of CFU; in fact, reduction was < 93% for the two irrigants. Conversely,statistically significant differences were found between the two activationtechniques (sonic and ultrasonic) in the reduction of Enterococcus Faecalis(EF). Thus, the effectiveness of ultrasonic activation was significantly higher (< 93%;p=0.012) as compared to sonic activation. Following the combination of the twoirrigants with the two activation techniques (groups A, B, C and D), significant differences were observed between group A and B (p=0.025) in the reduction of EF populations, reaching up to 94%.
 NaClO and CHX are effective in reducing intracanal bacterial load.Ultrasonic activation is the most effective activation technique in reducing EFpopulations.
