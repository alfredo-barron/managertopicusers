 Up to the half of twentieth century, Chievitz organ was considered an embryonal organ, disappearing with growth. But Zenker, in 1953, demonstratedthe existence of this organ in adult life, too4.
REVIEW: In this article we review the embryology, the macroscopic and microscopicanatomy, the ultrastructure, the functional significance and the pathology of theChievitz'Juxtaparotid Organ (CJO). The CJO is not a macroscopic apparent organ,but it looks like a nerve. The CJO takes connections with buccinator muscle, atthe level of the parotid duct, and the medial pterygoid muscle. The cellparenchyma is enveloped by the connective tissue, that is divided into threelayers15, 16: the inner layer -"stratum fibrosum internum"-, composed ofcollagenous and elastic microfibrils; the middle layer - "stratum nervosum" -containing a lamellar inner core and Ruffini SNF5; the external layer - "stratum fibrosum externum", that is a collagen capsule. The parenchymal cells show a richenzyme activity. The parenchymal cells may play the same role as glomus cells of the 1st type and Merkel cells20, 21. When a surgical resection is performed foran oral carcinoma, the CJO may be present in the specimen25. The CJO may bewrongly diagnosed as perineural invasion by carcinoma26, 27, 28.
 We report that Chievitz' organ is the only organ in which the cancer does not occur.
