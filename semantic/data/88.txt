Zatorska goose - a subject of parasitological research.
The aim of the study was to determine the level of gastrointestinal parasites in a native breed of geese - Zatorska goose - based on coproscopic testing. Faecalsamples were collected from 90 young geese in three age groups (5, 7 and 9 weeks old) in 2014. The geese were kept indoors on deep litter and pastured from springto autumn. The area of the pastures around the buildings where the geese grazedwas about 1 hectare, divided into quarters for different age groups. Beforegrazing, the birds were dewormed with fenbendazole (Fenbenat powder 4%, Naturan).As additional treatment for coccidiosis, coccidiostats were added to the feed.The study was conducted using the McMaster quantitative method withcentrifugation (flotation liquid: NaCl and glucose). The birds were shown to beinfected with coccidia and nematodes. The prevalence of Eimeria sp. infection(mean 40%) and the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (reaching 5,300 OPG) werehighest in the youngest age group of geese. The level of Amidostomum anserisinfection was similar in the three age groups, with prevalence from 40% to 50%(nematode egg output ranged from 50 to 350 eggs per gram of faeces, EPG).Capillaria anatis was observed only in 5- and 7-week-old geese.
