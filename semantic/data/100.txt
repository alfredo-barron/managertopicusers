Antimicrobial effects of Citrus sinensis peel extracts against dental cariesbacteria: An in vitro study.

 Ethnomedicine is gaining admiration since years but still there isabundant medicinal flora which is unrevealed through research. The study wasconducted to assess the in vitro antimicrobial potential and also determine theminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Citrus sinensis peel extracts with aview of searching a novel extract as a remedy for dental caries pathogens.
 Aqueous and ethanol (cold and hot) extracts prepared frompeel of Citrus sinensis were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity againstStreptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, using agar well diffusionmethod. The lowest concentration of every extract considered as the minimalinhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for both test organisms.One way ANOVA with Post Hoc Bonferroni test was applied for statistical analysis.Confidence level and level of significance were set at 95% and 5% respectively.
 Dental caries pathogens were inhibited most by hot ethanolic extract of Citrus sinensispeel followed by cold ethanolic extract. Aqueous extracts wereeffective at very high concentrations. Minimum inhibitory concentration of hotand cold ethanolic extracts of Citrus sinensis peel ranged between 12-15 mg/mlagainst both the dental caries pathogens.
 Citrus sinensispeels extract was found to be effective againstdental caries pathogens and contain compounds with therapeutic potential.Nevertheless, clinical trials on the effect of these plants are essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
