Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is defined as an intraductalmucin-producing neoplasm of the pancreatic ducts. IPMNs may be multifocal, havemalignant potential and exhibit a broad histological spectrum ranging fromadenoma to invasive carcinoma. The "hyperplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence" in the evolution of IPMNs is considered very similar to the "adenoma-carcinomasequence" of colorectal tumours. Patients with multifocal IPMN are potentialcandidates to total pancreatectomy, which still carries significant perioperativerisks, especially in the elderly. In selected cases a reasonable alternative tototal pancreatectomy is represented by the resection of the dominant tumourleaving deliberately in place the smaller, low-risk tumours. In this context,intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) can be useful to define the extent of IPMNsand to plan the surgical strategy. We report the case of a 84-year-old femalewith multiple IPMNs showing different stages of neoplastic progression up toinvasive carcinoma. The patient underwent IOUS-guided distalsplenopancreatectomy, while the small multiple branchduct type IPMNs of the head of the pancreas were considered at very low risk of neoplastic progression andwere deliberately left in place. The patient is alive without recurrence 96months after surgery and without evidence of progression of the branch-duct type IPMNs of the head of the pancreas. IOUS-guided pancreatectomy should beconsidered in selected elderly patients affected by multifocal IPMN evolved toinvasive carcinoma without evidence of distant metastases.
