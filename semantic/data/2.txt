 The brown tumour is an extreme form of osteitis fibrosa cystica,representing a serious complication of the advanced primary or secondaryhyperparathyroidism. It occurs in settings of high levels parathyroid hormone,like in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, with a frequency of 3-4% and1.5-13% respectively, usually affecting young people.
 The authors report a case of a 45 years old woman on long-termhemodialysis, with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. The main clinicalcomplaints were neck pain, lower thoraco-lumbar back pain, persistent left groin pain, and bilateral lower extremities weakness. The computed tomography scanrevealed multiple spine brown tumors affecting the cervical, thoracic and lumbar level. After an initial partial response to the treatment of two years withCinacalcet, a deterioration of the secondary hyperparathyroidism occurred(hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia) and the patient was referred forparathyroidectomy. The patient underwent total parathyroidectomy withauto-transplantation, with a positive postoperative result.
 Secondary hyperparathyroidism can lead, during its course, toosteolytic bone lesions called brown tumors. If the medical treatment fails, the surgical removal of the parathyroid glands with autotransplant remains the onlytreatment of the bone lesions progression. Reviewing the relevant literature inEnglish (until March 2015), we found 24 cases of symptomatic vertebral browntumors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case which describes amultilevel spine involvement (more than two), and the fifth describing a cervicallocalization.
