 The prognostic value of sentinel lymph node micrometastases in invasivebreast cancer patients is still widely debated. Even if, in the absence ofunequivocal guidelines, the axillary lynphadenectomy is not still performed inthe routine clinical care of these patients.
 We have retrospectively analyzed 746 patients with operable invasivebreast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. These patientsunderwent conservative surgery or total mastectomy with sentinel lymph nodebiopsy. Patients with micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node treated withaxillary dissection has been checked and the involvement of the remaining lymphnodes analyzed. Patients with micrometastases in the SLN not followed by axillarydissection have been checked as well and the incidence of recurrences has beenevaluated in both groups.
 Micrometastases were found in 51 (6.83%) patients and isolated tumorcells in 8 (1.07%) patients at frozen section and confirmed at the finalhystopathologic examination. Fifteen of these patients underwent completeaxillary dissection: two of them (13.33%) had metastatic involvement of otheraxillary lymph nodes. The other 44 patients didn't receive further surgicalaxillary procedure. No axillary recurrences in these patients were found during amedian follow up of 65.3Â±9.65 months (range 42-78 months).
 Based on the results and according to some recent randomized trialswe can say that axillary lynphadenectomy can be avoided when micrometastases are found in sentinel lynph nodes. It should be performed anyway, depending on theanalysis of the biomedical profile of the tumor.
