Role of Radiologic Imaging in Genetic and Acquired Neuromuscular Disorders.
Great technologic and clinical progress have been made in the last two decades inidentifying genetic defects of several neuromuscular diseases, as Spinal MuscularAtrophy, genetic muscular dystrophies and other genetic myopathies. The diagnosisis usually challenging, due to great variability in genetic abnormalities andclinical phenotypes and the poor specificity of complementary analyses, i.e.,serum creatine kinase (CK) and electrophysiology. Muscle biopsy represents thegold standard for the diagnosis of genetic neuromuscular diseases, but clinicalimaging of muscle tissue is an important diagnostic tool to identify andquantifyies muscle damage. Radiologic imaging is, indeed, increasingly used as a diagnostic tool to describe patterns and the extent of muscle involvement, thanksto modern techniques that enable to definethe definition of degrees of muscleatrophy and changes in connective tissue. They usually grade the severity of the disease process with greater accuracy than clinical scores. Clinical imaging ismore than complementary to perform muscle biopsy, especially as ultrasound scans are often mandatory to identify the muscle to be biopsied. We will here detailand provideWe will herein provide detailed examples of the radiologic methodsthat can be used in genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders, stressing pros and cons.
