Continuous neurophatic orofacial pain: A retrospective study of 23 cases.

 To determine the clinical characteristics of Continuous NeuropathicOrofacial Pain in patients that suffer Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain (PIFP), Painful Post-Traumatic Trigeminal Neuropathy (PPTTN) or Burning Mouth Syndrome(BMS) and to describe their treatment.
 A retrospective observational study was made, reviewing theclinical history of the patients diagnosed with Continuous Neuropathic Orofacial Pain between 2004 and 2011 at the Orofacial Pain Unit of the Master of OralSurgery and Implantology of the University of Barcelona and at the Orofacial PainUnit of the Teknon Medical Center of Barcelona.
 The average age of the patients with Continuous Neuropathic OrofacialPain was 54.5, with a clear female predominance (86.9%, n=20). Of all patients,60.9% (n=14) were suffering a PIFP, 21.7% (n=5) had a BMS and 17.4% (n=4) werepresenting a PPTTN. The pain quality described by the patients with ContinuousNeuropathic Orofacial Pain was oppressive (43.47%, n=10), widely represented bypatients with PIFP, and burning (39.13%, n=9) being the only quality thatdescribed patients with BMS. The treatment carried out with the patients was onlypharmacologic. The most used drugs for the treatment of PIFP and PPTTN wereclonazepam (50%, n=9) and amitriptyline (44.44%, n=8). However, a 55.5% (n=10) ofthe patients with PIFP or PPTTN required the association of two or more drugs fora correct pain control. All the patients with BMS responded satisfactorily toclonazepam.
 Continuous Neuropathic Orofacial Pain is a little known conditionamong the general population, physicians and dentists. This favors a latediagnosis and inaccurate treatments which entail unnecessary suffering. It isimportant to inform both the general population and health professionalsconcerning this painful condition.
