Parasites and fungi as risk factors for human and animal health.
Recent literature data suggests that parasitic and fungal diseases, which pose a threat to both human and animal health, remain a clinical, diagnostic andtherapeutic problem. Attention is increasingly paid to the role played by naturalmicrobiota in maintaining homeostasis in humans. A particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of manipulating the human microbiota (permanent, transient,pathogenic) and macrobiota (e.g., Trichuris suis) to support the treatment ofselected diseases such as Crohn's disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer. Emphasisis placed on important medical species whose infections not only impair healthbut can also be life threatening, such as Plasmodium falciparum, Echinococcusmultilocularis and Baylisascaris procyonis, which expand into areas which have sofar been uninhabited. This article also presents the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic parasitoses imported from the tropics, which spreadacross large groups of people through human-to-human transmission (Enterobiusvermicularis, Sarcoptes scabiei). It also discusses the problem ofenvironmentally-conditioned parasitoses, particularly their etiological factorsassociated with food contaminated with invasive forms (Trichinella sp.,Toxoplasma gondii). The analysis also concerns the presence of developmentalforms of geohelminths (Toxocara sp.) and ectoparasites (ticks), which are vectorsof serious human diseases (Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis), in theenvironment. Mycological topics contains rare cases of mycoses environmentallyconditioned (CNS aspergillosis) and transmissions of these pathogens in apopulation of hospitalized individuals, as well as seeking new methods used totreat mycoses.
