 An increase in intra-abdominal pressure causes a decrease in thesplanchnic blood flow and the intramucosal pH of the bowel, as well as increasingthe risk of ischemia in the colon. The aim of the present study is to evaluatethe effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the ischemia caused bylaparoscopy in colonic anastomosis in an experimental model of laparoscopiccolonic surgery.
 We divided 30 male Wistar albino rats into three groups:Group A was the control (open colon anastomosis); Group B received LCA(laparoscopic colon anastomosis); while Group C received both LCA and HBOT. Each group contained ten animals. We placed Group C (LCA and HBOT) in an experimental hyperbaric chamber into which we administered pure oxygen at 2.1 atmospheresabsolute 100% oxygen for 60 min for ten consecutive days.
 The anastomotic bursting pressure value was found to be higher in theopen surgery group (226 ± 8.8) (Group A). The result for Group C (213 ± 27),which received HBOT, was better than that for Group B (197 ± 27). However, there was no statistically significant difference between Group B and Group C. Group A showed better healing than the other groups, while significant differences in thefibroblast proliferation scores were found between Groups A and B. In terms oftissue hydroxyproline levels, a significant difference was found between Groups Aand B and between Groups A and C, but not between Groups B and C.
 HBOT increases the oxygen level in the injured tissue. Although HBOTmight offer several advantages, it had only a limited effect on the healing ofcolonic anastomosis in rats with increased intra-abdominal pressure in our study.
