Nutrition of students from dietetics profile education in the Siedlce University of Natural Sciences and Humanities compared with students from other academiccentres.

 Appropriate nutrition in humans is one of the most important factors affecting normal development, nutritional status and keeping healthy. University students can be overburdened with responsibilities arising from their studieswhich may result in abnormal diet/nutrition and decrease their levels of physicalactivity.
 To determine and assess nutrition and eating habits for selectedfemale students studying nutrition at the Siedlce University of Natural Sciences & Humanities (UPH), compared with young people from other academic centres alsostudying nutrition and having a similar education profile.
 A diagnostic survey was undertaken anonymously on 100female student subjects using a proprietary questionnaire. Students wereundergraduates at the UPH during their 2nd and 3rd year.
 Dietetics students considered that the practical application of propernutrition principles is very important. Nevertheless, 44% assessed themselves to follow abnormal diets; 58% declared they ate whole grains frequently whereas 58% and 65% respectively consumed fruit and vegetables daily. Dietary irregularities were identified, particularly in how often fish was eaten, where 46% either neverate fish or did so only occasionally. Subjects preferred lean cuts of poultrymeat (65%), and the most common cooking practice was frying (52%).
 Subjects did not follow dietary recommendations, although responses varied in the different academic centres. Despite learning from their studiesabout normal nutritional requirements it seems that, to large degree, studentsfollow eating habits acquired during their childhoods in the home.
