Evaluation of dietary intake of vitamins and minerals in 13-15-years-old boysfrom a sport school in Warsaw.

 Insufficient intake of vitamins and minerals, in teenagers engaged inphysical activity increases the risk of health disorders.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate selected vitamins and mineralsintake in 13-15-year-old boys from sport school.
 The study of dietary intake was conducted among 44 boysfrom the School of Sport Championship (SSC). Nutritional data was collected using24-hour recall for 3 days of week. Daily intake of minerals: sodium, potassium,calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, iodine and vitamins: A, E, D,B1, B2, B6, B12, C, folate and niacin was estimated. The probability ofinsufficient intake of nutrients in relation to the standard levels: EstimatedAverage Requirement (EAR) or Adequate Intake (AI) as well as excessive intake of them in relation to the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) were assessed.
 The highest percentage of insufficient intake concerned vitamin D(100%), potassium (69%), folate (53%), and calcium (50%), slightly lower ofmagnesium (27%), vitamins C (24%) and E (15%). The risk of inadequate intake ofother minerals: sodium, copper, iron, zinc, phosphorus, iodine and vitamins: B6, B1, B2, A, B12, niacin, was relatively lower and amounted from 0.3% to 5.4%. The disturbingly high probability of exceeding the UL for sodium (99.5%) wasobserved.
 A significant disproportion between the mean intake and thepercentage of inadequate diets indicates a large diversity in the intake ofvitamins and minerals in the group of studied boys, what was the reason ofunbalanced diet. The insufficient intake concerns especially vitamin D,potassium, folate, calcium and a lesser extent magnesium, vitamins C and E.Sodium intake was disturbingly high. In order to avoid nutritional mistakes inthe future education on the rational nutrition among students, their parents, andteachers is necessary.
