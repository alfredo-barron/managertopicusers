 The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of the circular compressionstapler and the circular mechanical stapler in transanal colorectal anastomosisafter left colectomy or anterior rectal resection.
 We performed a retrospective analysis of 10 patients with disease of the, sigmoid colon or rectum (carcinoma or diverticular disease) whounderwent left colectomy or anterior rectal resection with end-to-side transanal colorectal anastomosis. A follow-up was planned for all patients at 1, 3 and 6months after surgery and the anastomosis was evaluated by colonoscopy at 1 year.
 In all patients an end-to-side transanal colorectal anastomosis wasperformed using a circular compression stapler (CCS group) or circular mechanicalstaplers with titanium staples (CMS group). The mean distance of the anastomosis from the anal margin was 6.4 ± 1.5 cm in the CCS group and 18.2 ± 11.2 cm in the CMS group. All patients in the CCS group expelled the ring after a mean time of8.2 postoperative days. At 12 months colonoscopy revealed that all CCS patientshad a satisfactory anastomosis with mean size of the colic lumen at the level of anastomotic line of 26.3 mm.
 In our experience the circular compression stapler a valuablealternative to the circular mechanical stapler for the creation of transanalcolorectal anastomosis, in line with the relevant literature.
