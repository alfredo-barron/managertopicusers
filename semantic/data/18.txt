In vitro comparative study on the friction of stainless steel wires with andwithout Orthospeed® (JAL 90458) on an inclined plane.

 During the treatment of orthodontics, in the mechanics of slide,there takes place friction, which they reduce the slide of the arch acrossbracket. Therefore, clinical there takes place an increase of the time oftreatment. There are different the technologies that try to reduce this friction,as the self-ligating braces. The purpose of this study was to research the invitro behavior of JAL 90458 as a buffering agent which reduces friction betweenbrackets and stainless steel arch wires of different cross sections and sizes.
 Three types of stainless steel wires with different crosssections and three types of ligatures were used with and without JAL 90458 tomeasure the friction according to the time and distance traveled by the brackets on an inclined plane with two angulations. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis ofvariance by ranks was applied to determine the degree of friction between thegroup using and the group not using the product (P ≤ .05).
 Separate analysis of the arch wires, ligatures and angulation with andwithout the compound revealed statistically significant differences between thegroups, showing that friction was reduced significantly when JAL 90458 was used(P ≤ .01). The 0.021x0.025" arch wires and the arch wires attached using elastic ligatures produce the least resistance to sliding among all of those analyzedwhen the product was not used (P ≤ .05).
 The results show that JAL 90458 reduces friction independently ofarch wire cross section, type of ligature and angulation of the measuringinstrument.
