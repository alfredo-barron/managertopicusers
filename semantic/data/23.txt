Effect of retention design of artificial teeth and implant-supported titaniumCAD-CAM structures on fracture resistance.

 For implant-supported hybrid prostheses, high mastication forces and reduced acrylic resin thickness over a metal substructure often cause failuresarising from tooth or resin fractures. To assay fracture resistance of artificialteeth and resin in implant-supported hybrid prostheses in relation to thetitanium structure and retention design supporting teeth.
 40 specimens bearing incisors were divided into four groupsaccording to the titanium structure supporting the teeth and the type of loadforce applied: Group I (Control; n=10): Application of static loading to tenincisors set over a metal structure with internal retention. Group II (Control;n=10): Application of static loading to ten incisors set over a metal structurewith external retention. The remaining study specimens (n=20) were subjected to120,000 masticatory and thermal cycles in a chewing simulator. Afterwards, staticloading was applied until the point of fracture using an Instron machine. GroupIII (Study; n=10): Application of dynamic and static loading to ten incisors set over a metal structure with internal retention. Group IV (Study; n=10):Application of dynamic and static loading to ten incisors set over a metalstructure with external retention. Data obtained for the four groups was analyzedand compared, determining the type of fracture (cohesive or adhesive) using areflected light microscope.
 Statistical analysis confirmed that there were significant differencesin fracture resistance between the four groups. External retention was found tohave more fracture resistance than the internal retention.
 Hybrid prostheses with titanium substructures and external retentionobtained significantly better results than samples with internal retention.
