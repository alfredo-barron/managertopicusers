Frequency of consumption of foods rich in calcium and vitamin D among school-age children.

 Calcium is one of the most important minerals for the human bodywhich is essential for healthy bones and teeth. Vitamin D has hormone-likeproperties in the human body. It is supplied with the diet, but it is alsosynthesized by the body under exposure to UV radiation. Vitamin D controlscalcium and phosphorus metabolism and is responsible for bone modeling andmineralization.
 The objective of this study was to evaluate eating habits and foodpreferences of school-age children meet the demand for calcium and vitamin D, andestimate the frequency of consumption of foods rich in these nutrients.
 A total of 197 parents of 7- to 9-year-olds attendingrandomly selected primary schools in Lublin and Åšwidnik were asked to fill out a questionnaire designed by the authors. The results were processed by theChi-squared test in the Excel application.
 Considerable differences in the consumption of milk and dairy productswere observed between age groups. In the group of 7-year-olds, 57.5% of children drank milk and ate dairy products at least once a day, whereas in the group of9-year-olds, only 16.6% of children ate dairy products at least once a day. Theintake of foods rich in vitamin D was equally low among the surveyed children.
 School-age children may be at risk of calcium and vitamin Ddeficiencies due to low consumption of milk, dairy products and fish, andinadequate vitamin D supplementation. Parents should be educated about nutrition to change the family's eating habits.
