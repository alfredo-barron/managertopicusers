Relationship between diet and physical activity level in adolescents frompost-grammar schools.

 Appropriate diet and physical activity are vital determinants ofpsychophysical development in children and adolescents.
 The aim of the study was to analyse an association between dietaryhabits and physical activity levels of adolescents from post-grammar schools.
 The study included 110 girls and 65 boys between 16 and 19 years of age from two post-grammar schools in Biała Podlaska in Poland. They weresubjected to a diagnostic survey providing information on their diet (number ofmeals a day, their regularity, frequency of bread, dairy, meat, fish, sweet,fruit, vegetable and fast food consumption, preferred ways of food processing).Physical activity levels were determined with the International Physical ActivityQuestionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Based on these data, the respondents werestratified to high, moderate and low physical activity groups. Due to smallnumber of participants presenting with low physical activity levels, we did notinclude this group in further analyses. The significance of differences in thedietary habits of adolescents presenting with high and moderate physical activitylevels was verified with the χ2 test.
 Most girls and boys presented with high levels of physical activity.However, we did not find an evident relationship between dietary habits andphysical activity levels. Girls from high and moderate physical activity groupsdiffered solely in terms of the number of daily meals, frequency of meat andsweet consumption, and significant intergroup differences observed among boyspertained to the frequencies of whole-wheat bread, meat and fast foodconsumption. The abovementioned food products were consumed more often by girlsand boys presenting with high physical activity levels.
 The dietary mistakes observed in physically active adolescents from post-secondary schools justify intensification of their dietary educationprograms.
