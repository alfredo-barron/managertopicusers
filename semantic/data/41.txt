The European AstRoMap project (supported by the European Commission SeventhFramework Programme) surveyed the state of the art of astrobiology in Europe and beyond and produced the first European roadmap for astrobiology research. In the context of this roadmap, astrobiology is understood as the study of the origin,evolution, and distribution of life in the context of cosmic evolution; thisincludes habitability in the Solar System and beyond. The AstRoMap Roadmapidentifies five research topics, specifies several key scientific objectives for each topic, and suggests ways to achieve all the objectives. The five AstRoMapResearch Topics are • Research Topic 1: Origin and Evolution of Planetary Systems• Research Topic 2: Origins of Organic Compounds in Space • Research Topic 3:Rock-Water-Carbon Interactions, Organic Synthesis on Earth, and Steps to Life• Research Topic 4: Life and Habitability • Research Topic 5: Biosignatures asFacilitating Life Detection It is strongly recommended that steps be takentowards the definition and implementation of a European Astrobiology Platform (orInstitute) to streamline and optimize the scientific return by using acoordinated infrastructure and funding system.
