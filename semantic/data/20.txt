Prognostic value of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in oral squamous cellcarcinoma and its association with angiogenesis.

 Breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the importanthallmarks of cancer progression which facilitates the invasion of tumoral cellsto the surrounding tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade variouscomponents of the ECM and basement membrane. The aim of this study was todetermine the role of matrix metalloproteinases-9 protein in the biologicbehavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its relation with tumorangiogenesis.
 In this study 42 OSCC and 15 normal epithelium werereviewed by immunohistochemical staining for matrix metalloproteinases-9 andCD105.
 Matrix metalloproteinases-9 expression was detected in 32 OSCC specimens(76.1%), with 28 specimens (66.6%) showing moderate or strong expression. Weobserved that the expression level of matrix metalloproteinases-9 was positively correlated with the status of lymph node metastasis (N0vs. N1) (P =0.00), andclinical stage (I-II vs. III-IV) in OSCC patients. Microvessel density inintratumoral tissue has an association with lymph node metastasis and advancedclinical stage (P=0.003 and p=0.01, respectively). We observed that tumors withmatrix metalloproteinases-9 overexpression had a higher microvessel densitycounts compared with tumors with absent or focal immunostaining(16.2±5.6 vs10.3±3.5 respectively, P =0.03).
 In conclusion present results demonstrate the marked expression ofmatrix metalloproteinases-9 and CD105 in OSCC and suggest that the expression of these markers is associated with tumor progression and could offer additionalinformation about the aggressiveness of OSCC. In addition a significantrelationship was noted between microvessel density count and expression of matrixmetalloproteinases-9 which suggest that MMP9 expression may be closely related totumor angiogenesis.
