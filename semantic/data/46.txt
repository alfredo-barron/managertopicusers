Perspectives on Comets, Comet-like Asteroids, and Their Predisposition to Providean Environment That Is Friendly to Life.
In recent years, studies have shown that there are many similarities betweencomets and asteroids. In some cases, it cannot even be determined to which ofthese groups an object belongs. This is especially true for objects found beyond the main asteroid belt. Because of the lack of comet fragments, more progress hasbeen made concerning the chemical composition of asteroids. In particular, theSMASSII classification establishes a link between the reflecting spectra andchemical composition of asteroids and meteorites. To find clues for the chemical structure of comets, the parameters of all known asteroids of the SMASSIIclassification were compared to those of comet groups like the Encke-type comets,the Jupiter-family comets, and the Halley-type comets, as well as comet-likeobjects like the damocloids and the centaurs. Fifty-six SMASSII objects similarto comets were found and are categorized as comet-like asteroids in this work.Aside from the chemistry, it is assumed that the available energy on thesecelestial bodies plays an important role concerning habitability. For thedetermination of the available energy, the effective temperature was calculated. Additionally, the size of these objects was considered in order to evaluate thepossibility of a liquid water core, which provides an environment that is morelikely to support processes necessary to create the building blocks of life.Further study of such objects could be notable for the period of the Late HeavyBombardment and could therefore provide important implications for ourunderstanding of the inner workings of the prebiotic evolution within the SolarSystem since the beginning.
