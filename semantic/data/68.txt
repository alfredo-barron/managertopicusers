 The most dreaded complication of thyroidectomy is recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, which is most of the time hardly irreversible. In our experimental study we researched the use of free nerve grafts in the treatment of laryngeal nervedamage in rabbit.
 There were three groups in our study. In the first group,the recurrent laryngeal nerve was severed and then a free nerve graft wasinterposed between the phrenic nerve and distal end of recurrent laryngeal nerve.In the second group, a defect in the continuity of the laryngeal nerve wascreated. The two ends of the nerve were joined together later by an interposedfree nerve graft. In the third group, only a defect in the recurrent nerve wascreated without any attempt at uniting the ends together so that these lattersubjects could be assigned as control group. In the evaluation process weperformed laryngeal endoscopy, laryngeal EMG and histopathologic examination.
 On the 21. day of trial, in the first and second group vocal cordmovements were detected on the laryngoscopy along with regeneration waves on EMG.In the third group there was no vocal cord movements on the side where a neuraldamage was created intentionally. On EMG there was degeneration waves as opposed to regeneration waves seen in the first and second groups. Histopathologicfindings were similar.
 Recurrrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is an unwanted complicationbecause it causes permenant sequela. Studies which intend to find a cure for thiscomplication are increasing in number. We aim to find new approaches to curepatients suffering from this devastating complication as well. In ourexprerimental study, vocal cord movements were reproduced without causingdiaphragmatic paralysis. We believe the results of our study promise to relievethe suffering of patients. The results are encouraging.
