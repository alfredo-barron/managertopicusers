Nutritional knowledge, diet quality and breast or lung cancer risk: acase-control study of adults from Warmia and Mazury region in Poland.

 Knowledge on proper nutrition favours the creation of pro-healthynutritional behaviours of people. Studies related to the nutritional knowledge ofadults, diet quality and incidence of breast or lung cancers are limited.
 Analysis of the relationship between the level of nutritionalknowledge, diet quality and risk of breast cancer in women or lung cancer in men from the Warmia and Mazury region in Poland.
 The study was carried out in 202 subjects aged 23-80 years,including 107 women (17 cases of breast cancer) and 95 men (54 cases of lungcancer) from the Warmia and Mazury region in Poland. Nutritional knowledge wasevaluated with the Questionnaire of Eating Behaviours (QEB), including 25statements. Based on the frequency of the consumption of 16 food items, two diet quality indices were created: the pro-Healthy-Diet-Index-8 (pHDI-8) and thenon-Healthy-Diet-Index-8 (nHDI-8). The values of pHDI-8 and nHDI-8 werecalculated on the basis of the sum of the daily frequency of consumption of theselected food items and expressed as times/day. The Odds Ratio (OR) of bothbreast cancer or lung cancer in relation to the level of nutritional knowledgewas calculated based on a logistic regression analysis.
 The incidence of breast or lung cancer in the bottom, middle and uppertertile of nutritional knowledge was 57.6%, 32.6% and 15.8%, respectively. Asnutritional knowledge grew in the subsequent tertiles, pHDI-8 was on the increase(2.63 vs. 3.78 vs. 4.22 times/day) and n-HDI-8 was on the decrease (1.32 vs. 1.21vs. 0.94 times/day). In the upper tertile of nutritional knowledge, the OddsRatio for the incidence of breast or lung cancers varied from 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02;0.17; p<0.05, with adjustment for cancer type and age) to 0.17 (95% CI: 0.04;0.69; p<0.05, with adjustment for age and sex) when compared to the bottomtertile (OR=1.00). In the middle tertile of nutritional knowledge, the Odds Ratioof both cancers varied from 0.27 (95% CI: 0.12; 0.62, p<0.05, with adjustment forcancer type and age) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.18; 0.71, p<0.05, variables withoutadjustment) when compared to the bottom tertile.
 A higher level of nutritional knowledge was associated with thehigher quality of a pro-healthy diet and lower risk of breast cancer in women or lung cancer in men. In contrast, a lower level of nutritional knowledge wasassociated with a lower diet quality and a higher risk of both types of cancers.
