Desmoplastic fibroblastoma (collagenous fibroma) of the oral cavity.
Desmoplastic fibroblastoma is benign soft tissue tumor, with fibroblastic ormyofibroblastic origin, that rarely occurs in oral cavity. We reported the caseof a 56-year-old man who presented a tumor in the left mandibular alveolar ridge,with slow and asymptomatic growth, with no osseous involvement. The tumor wassessile with lobulated surface, covered by healthy mucosa with erythematousareas. The lesion was excised and specimens sent to histopathology andimmunohistochemistry. Histopathological exam showed a non-encapsulatedfibroblastic proliferation, characterized by myofibroblasts, spindle and stellatefibroblasts with large or oval nuclei and bi or tri nucleation, immersed in anabundant hypocellular dense collagen stroma. Tumor cells were positive forvimentin, HHF35, Î±-smooth muscle actin and factor XIIIa. The diagnosis ofdesmoplastic fibroblastoma was based in the clinical history of absence of traumarelated to the growth in the alveolar ridge, associated with macroscopic,microscopic and immunohistochemical features. The patient is free-diseases byeight months.
