Effect of glycine pretreatment on the shear bond strength of a CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic material to dentin.

 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of glycinepretreatment on the shear bond strength between dentin and a CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic material (LavaTM Ultimate Restorative), bonded together with adhesivecements using three different luting protocols (total-etch; self-etch;self-adhesive).
 Thirty cylinders were milled from resin nano ceramic blockswith CAD/CAM technology. The cylinders were subsequently cemented to the exposed dentin of 30 bovine permanent mandibular incisors. The specimens were assignedinto six groups of five teeth each according to luting procedure and dentinpretreatment. In the first two groups (A1, A2) 10 cylinders were cemented using atotal-etch protocol; in groups B1 and B2, 10 cylinders were cemented using aself-etch protocol; in groups C1 and C2, 10 cylinders were cemented using aself-adhesive protocol; in groups A1, B1 and C1 the dentinal surface was alsotreated with glycine powder. All cemented specimens were submitted to a shearbond strength test. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 9.0 software.
 ANOVA showed the presence of significant differences among the variousgroups (P <0.0001).
 Glycine did not change the different bond strength demonstrated bythe various luting protocols tested. Conventional resin composite cements usedtogether with a self-etch adhesive reported the highest values. However the useof glycine seems to increase the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cements.
