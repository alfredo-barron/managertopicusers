 With the expanded use of laparoscopy, the options for combined surgicalprocedures have also increased and can be a modality of choice for coexistingpathologies in the abdomen. In our study we evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a number of surgical procedures combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy andreport our results.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: We conducted a retrospective study on 19 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy simultaneously with other operations.
 No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Postoperative complicationsoccurred in three patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 3 days(range 2-4) and a few patients required more than 48 hours postoperativehospitalization. The perioperative mortality rate was 0%.
 Concomitant surgical procedures result in longer operating time, but certainly the patient benefits from a single exposure to anesthesia, singlehospital stay, and single period of absence from work.
 Combining surgeries does not significantly alter the outcome of the procedure, proved to be a safe and feasible and present an interestingalternative to two separate operations. Prospective studies with long-termfollow-up are required to better understand the implications of simultaneousoperations.
