 To evaluate clinical and histopathological changes of gastric cancer (GC) inthe last fifteen years and analyze factors influencing overall survival.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: We have retrospectively categorized patients submitted tosurgery for GC from January 1996 to December 2010. The analysis focused on twoperiods: 1996-2003 (period 1) and 2004-2010 (period 2).
 There was an increase in age distribution of GC in period 2 (p=0.012).Significant increase of whole GC was observed in period 2 (p=0.01). Slight butsignificant changes in TNM stage were found: in group 2 there was a decrease inthe rate of early GC and in advanced depth of tumor invasion; increase of lymphnodes involvement was also demonstrated. Overall survival (OS) had not changedfrom the first to the second period. There was a significant difference in OScalculated for Lauren histotype: from ten months to surgery, patients withdiffuse histotype showed worse prognosis.
 The most important findings were an increase in lymph nodeinvolvement and a decrease in depth of tumor invasion, an higher percentage ofwhole type and a decrease in palliative surgery. Overall-survival hasn't changein the last fifteen years. These results confirms the importance of extent oflymph node dissection in the standard surgical approach of GC, the tumor stageand Lauren histotypes as the main prognostic factors in GC.
 This work confirms the dismal prognosis of GC and the need toincrease diagnosis of early gastric cancer.
