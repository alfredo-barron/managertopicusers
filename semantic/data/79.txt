 Isolated hepatic splenosis is a rare but possible condition in abdominalsurgery. At radiological imaging liver splenosis mimics malignant or pathologicalcondition of the liver; obtaining a certain diagnosis prior to surgery isdifficult. For this reason, the patients undergo to unnecessary operation, with alaparotomy access. We report a case of suspicious liver mass removedlaparoscopically and revealed as hepatic splenosis.
 A 31 years old man patient was admitted to our Institution becauseof upper chronic abdominal pain. Thirteen years before the recovery the patientwas operated of splenectomy with laparotomic incision. Computerized Tomographyand Magnetic Resonance demonstrated the presence of suspicious hepatic mass inthe III segment.
 The mass has been radically excised with laparoscopic approach.Postoperative stay was good and patient was discharged seven day after theoperation. At histological examination ectopic splenic tissue on liver surfacewas found (socalled splenosis).
DISCUSSION AND  Hepatic splenosis is not a rare condition and shouldbe considered with the differential diagnosis especially in patients who hadprevious splenectomy and absence of liver cirrhosis. Laparoscopic explorationshould always be preferred for the diagnosis of uncertain liver mass. Few worksreport laparoscopic excision for liver splenosis. For experience at ourInstitution laparoscopic procedure has an important role to get the diagnosis andit is also a feasible approach for minimally invasive resection.
