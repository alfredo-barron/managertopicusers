Molecular characterization and seroprevalence of Echinococcus granulosus in wild boars (Sus scrofa) in south-western Iran.
This study presents the first molecular and serological evaluation ofEchinococcus granulosus infections in wild boars in Iran. Twenty five wild boars were collected in south-western Iran, during authorized hunting program, fromMarch to October 2013, necropsied and examined for E. granulosus infection.Furthermore, seroprevalence of cystic echinococcosis in hunted boars wasevaluated by an ELISA system. A fertile hydatid cyst due to E. granulosus wasdetected in the lung of one of the animals. Genotype analysis of the isolate was determined by analyzing a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1(co1). DNA was extracted from the cyst sample and polymerase chain reactionamplification and DNA sequencing of the specific region of the co1 gene wasperformed. Molecular evaluation confirmed the presence of a sheep strain, the G1 genotype, in the wild boar in south-western Iran. This is the first report of thepresence of G1 genotype of E. granulosus in wild boar in Iran. Serologicalevaluation of hydatid cyst by antigen-B ELISA revealed E. granulosus antibodiesin 5 (20%) of 25 wild boars. A statistically significant difference was observed between the prevalence of E. granulosus antibodies and gender while thedifference between the seroprevalence of E. granulosus and age was insignificant.Findings of this study might have important implications for the prevention andcontrol of cystic echinococcosis.
