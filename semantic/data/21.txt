Evaluation of three different rotary systems during endodontic retreatment -Analysis by scanning electron microscopy.

 Endodontic therapy is considered a series of important andinterdependent steps, and failure of any of these steps may compromise thetreatment outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of threedifferent rotary systems in removing obturation materials during endodonticretreatment using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis.
 Thirty-six endodontically treated teeth were selected anddivided into 3 groups of 10 and 1 control group with 6 dental elements. Thegroups were divided according to the rotary system used for removinggutta-percha, as follows: G1: ProTaper system; G2: K3 system; G3: Mtwo system;and G4: Control group. Thereafter, the roots were split and the sections wereobserved under SEM, for analysis and counting of clear dentinal tubules, creatingthe variable "degree of dentinal tubule patency" (0: intensely clear; 1:moderately clear; 2: slightly clear; 3: completely blocked). The data weresubjected to the Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests.
 No differences were observed in the "degree of dentinal tubule patency" neither between the root thirds (to each evaluated group) nor between the groups (to each evaluated third). Nevertheless, when the three root thirds were grouped (providing evaluation of all root extension), the "degree of dentinal tubulepatency" was lower in G1 than in G3 (p<0.05), but showed no differences neitherbetween G1 and G2 nor G2 and G3.
 No technique was able to completely remove the canal obturationmaterial, despite G1 having shown better results, although without significantdifference to G2
