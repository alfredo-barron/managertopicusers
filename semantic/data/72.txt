 Our study is to demonstrate the feasibility and the safety of theMinilaparoscopic Cholecystectomy.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: During one year period 12 patients underwent 5mm Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and 102 patientunderwent Mini-laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. Inthis study the exclusion criteria for surgery have been analyzed as well as thetechnical difficulties, the operation time, the duration of hospital stay, thepost-surgery pain, the complications and the aesthetic results
 The operation time was 3 minutes longer for Mini-laparoscopicCholecystectomy, the hospital stay was shorter in Mini-laparoscopic group.Patients that underwent 5mm Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy required a longeranalgesic therapy. Complications occurred during the study were not related tothe method. The aesthetic results were better in Minilaparoscopic Cholecystectomydue to lower scars length. Only in two cases we converted the plannedMini-laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in 5mm Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.
 All the patients submitted to Mini-laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and5mm Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy had the same therapeutic result. TheMini-laparoscopic Cholecystectomy gave advantages on post-surgery pain andrecovery time.
 In our experience the Mini-laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is a safemethod that guarantees the same clinical results of conventional LaparoscopicCholecystectomy. It shows some technical difficulties, but yet this surgery is tobe recommended to expert surgeons.
