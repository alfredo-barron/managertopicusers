Comparison of working length control consistency between hand K-files and MtwoNiTi rotary system.

 The purpose of this study was to investigate the consistency ofworking length control between hand instrumentation in comparison to enginedriven Mtwo nickel-titanium rotary files.
 Forty extracted maxillary molars were selected and divided onto two parallel groups. The working lengths of the mesiobuccal root canals wereestimated. The teeth were fixed in a phantom head. The root canal preparation wascarried out group 1 (n=20) with hand K-files, (VDW, Munich, Germany) and group 2 (n=20) with Mtwo instruments (VDW, Munich, Germany). Vestibulo-oral andmesio-distal directional x-ray images were taken before the preparation with #10 K-file, inserted into the mesiobuccal root canal to the working length, and afterpreparation with #25, #30 and #40 files. Working lenght changes were detectedwith measurements between the radiological apex and the instrument tips.
 In the Mtwo group a difference in the working competency (p<0.05) could be noticed only in the vestibulo-oral direction from #10 to #40 file. The handinstrument group showed a significant difference in working length competency foreach larger file size (p<0.05) (ANOVA). Regression analysis in the handinstrumentation group indicated a working length decrease with a mean of 0,2 mmafter each consecutive file size (p<0.01).
 The outcome of our trial indicated a high consistency in workinglength control for root canal preparation under simulated clinical conditionusing Mtwo rotary files. Mtwo NiTi rotary file did therefore proved to be moreaccurate in comparison to the conventional hand instrumentation.
